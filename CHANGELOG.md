- first functionally complete implementation of ERC1155 Circles implementation

## [Unreleased]

- Make the trust relationship binary (and deprecate the trust limit). Rather than storing a binary mapping, we opt to store a linked list of the trusted nodes. This facilitates iterating from the contract state.

- The default time behaviour for contract state is to update per block. The social graph is rich data structure other processes need to compute over. While adding edges to the graph is a monotonic operation, removing (untrusting) edges can cause concurrency problems with path solvers. We therefore want the (edge-removal) changes to the graph to happen at a predictable, slower pace than the token flow across the graph.
